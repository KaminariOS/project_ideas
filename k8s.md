# K8S record and replay for debugging faults  

Recording only the control plane is easy and a research project [simkube](https://github.com/acrlabs/simkube) is doing this.

However, in production environments, faults can surface at any level(Application, virtualization, kenrl and hardware) of the system.

What if it is only for AI agent evaluation?

AI agents are stupid and the tools they use are limited
